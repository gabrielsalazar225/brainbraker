# It calls BRAINBRAKER 
So I dont really know how to make the readme for the particular challenge so i just goin to brake down the js code in pieces.

## const addEmployeesBtn = document.querySelector('#add-employees-btn')

What we did here was point in the id "add-employees-btn" on the html code.

## addEmployeesBtn.addEventListener

This part of the code makes a lot of things on our code.

1) Here is where we call the action of 'click' and the logic behind that. 

2) We create variables or the array and also a boolean true to run the 'while loop' that we will do later.

3) We create a while loop with the 3 values on the array as the task indicate 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'Salary'. All the values has the 'promp' method to be displayed in our page. And for last but not less important we indicate that the value salary will accept jus 'Numbers' Thru 'isNaN' Method. 

4) Also we used 'Push' to allows the program to add new values. 

5) Finally we return to employees to start the sequence again
